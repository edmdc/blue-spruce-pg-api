# Blue Spruce Plant Guide API

The [original project](https://github.com/edmdc89-turing-student-projects/blue-spruce-plant-guide)
can be found under the [organization](https://github.com/edmdc89-turing-student-projects)
for my projects as a student at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).
I recreated this front-end project as a full-stack application demonstrate the
technologies and concepts explored in the weeks following my graduation from
Turing. The front-end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/edmdc89/blue-spruce-plant-guide-v2).

## Abstract

I built this learning tool to explore native plants in Colorado. It's a GraphQL
server that brings together Trefle, [the plant API](https://trefle.io/), with
a MongoDB database to track users and their quizzes.

I graduated Turing as a front-end engineer where I got comfortable consuming
RESTful APIs. After solidifying my grasp on front-end development, my curiosity
began to extend toward the inner workings of web API. With this project I seek to
explore the basic concepts and best practices when developing modern web API.

#### GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and server-side runtime to fulfill those
queries. It creates a self-documenting API by using a type system rather than
endpoints to define the structure of data and how to obtain it. It can consolidate
multiple REST APIs into one source that allows developers to make one single
request for desired data. GraphQL comes equipped with powerful developer tools
that allow for the exploration of the API's whole type system.

These combined features help front- and back-end developers create software
synchronously and talk about the API decoupled from teams' preferred languages
increasing overall development speed.
